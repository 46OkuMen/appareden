A bunch at 4c140-4c1d0

ap_before ap_after:

503: 00's -> 32 4b  (this is an input buffer)

43cd: a8 e3 -> bc e7 -> 80 db (probably "which image was loaded")

46b8: 01 -> 00 ( flips 0 to 1 while idling)

4948: e3 77 -> c4 6b (flips while idling)

4ab0-4af0: a lot (flips while idling)
4bd0-4bf0: a lot (?)
4c40-4c70: a lot (flips while idling)
4d90-4db0 (looks related to opening the menu)
97d0-99e0: flips while idling (looks like a bunch of timers, they just count up)
9b00-9d60 - sparse values that flip while idling
a5e2 -> Weird small values that count down and repeat from 02... battles only seem to occur when it's a 00.
	But it doesn't seem to be affected by the repel item.
11750: Save fiel/inventory count, probably
1ac20 -> flips while idling

3d8f0 -> this might be which "region" of the world map you're in? Changing it does crazy shit

3d8ca -> Character x position
3d8cb -> Character y position
3d91e(*) -> Number of steps left in the repel.
3d912 -> Counts up to 08 with every step (Poison damage counter)


Before/after the repel wears off:
3312: Some kind of step counter, goes up as you walk

The solution is to just nop out the "75 03" branch right before the "check if the encounter type is 00, 01, or 02". So just skip the check entirely

Side note: Need to fix the "it wore off" message. "rnal"
Also, "Unable to disembark here(line)"
In dungeons, "x acquired" needs one less or one fewer character
Field menu header is now "Save to which journal entry?" for some reason
