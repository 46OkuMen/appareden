Four sets of spaces:

0x29069 (4)
0x2906e (3) - Name-Level
0x29072 (3) - Level-HP
...
0x29083 (2) - HP-ZP

Name-Level, Level-HP, HP-ZP, ZP-Status

Nothing seems to affect ZP-Status? Status stays where it is, so stuff runs into it...

I can move Ok by just adding some spaces in front of Ok. That'll be fine.
