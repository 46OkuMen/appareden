SCN12307.MSG

After battle with Okitsugu, he says a line of dialogue and the screen shakes and the game crashes.

Each #00, #01, etc. control code signifies a "scene".

#[00]: Pre-battle
#[01]: Okitsugu "This... this can't be.... I can't be defeated by children such as theeesee..."
Earthquake happens, crash
#[02]: Gento "What's this? An earthquake?"

I need it to skip the part having to do with #01 at all.

SCN12307.COD

Looking at all mentions of 01.

0x7d - Switching it to 02 loads #02 instead, with earthquake afterward. Can load any scene in the MSG.

There are 17 5ds. Seems like 17 screen shakes too.
